# task-manager
Simple task manager comprising servers and tasks

You have to create a task manager comprising of servers and tasks.

**What is a server?**

A server is a program that executes a task. Here, one server can perform only one task at a time.

**What is a task?**

A task is a piece of work to be done. Here a task will be presented by a linear progress bar that fills itself completely in 20 seconds. A timer will be running beside the task to show the time left to complete it. 

The system will have the following functionalities:

**Add a server:** The system will start with only 1 server and more servers can be added using the "Add a server" button. The system can have a minimum of 1 server & a maximum of 10 servers running simultaneously.

**Remove a server**: An idle server can be removed from the system by pressing the "Remove a server" button. If a server is not performing any task it will be removed immediately, however, if a server is doing a job it'll be removed after completing the job.

**Add tasks:** The system will start with 0 tasks. N number of tasks can be added to the task queue by entering N and pressing the "Add tasks" button. 

**Task execution:** A task starts immediately if there is a server available. If the server is not available, the task gets added to the task queue. A task that has not started yet can be removed by pressing a delete button. A task in the progress can't be removed or stopped. 

No libraries used.

All the best!
