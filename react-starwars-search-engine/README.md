# Star Wars Search-Engine

## The Story
A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away...

It is a period of civil war. Rebel spaceships, striking from a hidden base, have won their first victory against the evil Galactic Empire.

During the battle, rebel spies manageed to steal secret plans to the Empire's ultimate weapon. Rather oddly these plans contain
blueprints for a UI component to search for Star Wars characters by name. Perplexed, the Rebel Command decides to build this for themselves.

You are tasked with building this component to help the rebels restore freedom to the galaxy...

## The Assignment
This repository contains a basic scaffolding of a React app. We have purposefully kept the dependencies to a minimum, 
it is by no means supposed to be a limitation. You can go ahead and introduce any library/software system that you 
feel will help you create a better solution. Needless to say please do not use a Search library/component :)

You can make use of the publicly accessible API Service — [Star Wars API — SWAPI](https://swapi.dev/). Use the `/people/` endpoint to search for characters.

We have included designs for the component in the repository. Try to stick close to the design, but if you feel like something can be done better
please feel free to change it. We would love to discuss that in the discussions that follow.

## Installing and Running
The repository contains a minimal scaffolding created with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). This is only meant as
a starting point and you are free to change the structure if you wish. 

1. To get started, install your dependencies
```
npm install
```

2. Run the app in development mode
```
npm start
```

3. That's it!

## 1—Search Component
You are to build a search component to search for characters by name. Similar to how Google's search box works
we expect the component to search as the user is typing. Also ensure the user can use the keyboard to navigate the results (Arrow keys and Enter to select)

Also, be mindful of calling the API at a reasonable rate as the user is typing.

## 2—Character Page
The user should be able to select a character from search results and view details about the character. Build a simple page
which shows details about the chosen character. 

We have not shared a design for this page on purpose. You're free to build it to your own taste. Don't worry, we do not expect you to
be an expert designer.


May the Force be with you
